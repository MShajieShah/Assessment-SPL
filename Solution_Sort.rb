# Write a sort function to sort the following string. You are not allowed to use any builtin sort function that are provided by language libraries.
# You have to sort the string first according to digits and then according to alphabetical order.
# Write your own sort function that you think, will be suitable in case of this type of data and will be faster.
# Also write your reasoning why you are choosing certain algorithum. And write the time and space complexity

# Example
# Input  "0a12b3c4e5r"
# Output "012345abcer"

# Input  "998800zzccxxxaaa"
# Output "008899aaaccxxxzz"

# String can be much longer like this
# 8923092103912391923120931209031923019230192039120391203912039120312093
